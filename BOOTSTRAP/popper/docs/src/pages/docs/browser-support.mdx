# Browser Support

Popper supports modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and IE11 with
polyfills. Additionally, any Chromium-based browser, such as Edge (2020), Opera,
etc should be supported.

## IE11

IE11 (and older browsers in general) require polyfills to work. The simplest way
to make Popper work is to use the following polyfill service:

```html
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=Array.prototype.find,Array.prototype.includes,Array.from,Object.entries,Promise,Object.assign"></script>
```

Browsers that don't need the polyfills won't be burdened with the JS bundle
size.

### Support note

If you need to support old browsers, ensure you **lock** Popper's version to a
specific number when using the CDN. On new releases, we may add more modern
functions that require new polyfills, or positioning behavior may break in IE11
since it is completely untested. We don't plan to officially support IE11, but
welcome PRs to fix issues. For the most part, IE11 seems to work without much
trouble, but there may be edge cases in some scenarios.

## IE10 and older

Browsers older than 2013 (including Android 4.4) will never be supported since
they are becoming increasingly obsolete and add a lot of complexity (runtime and
bundle) costs to the library.
