# Typings

Popper comes with type definitions for both Flow and TypeScript.

The project is type checked by Flow, and type definitions for TypeScript are
automatically generated from its source code.

## Flow

Rather than exporting limited type definitions, we link to the Flow-typed source
files from the `dist/umd` folder.

Flow will automatically read the exposed types, so you don't need to change any
configuration in your project to take benefit from Popper typings.

It's although reccomended to add the following lines to your `.flowconfig` file
in order to instruct Flow not to report type errors originating from your
`node_modules` folder. Type definitions exposed by the modules will still be
used, but their errors, if any, will be ignored.

```ini
[declarations]
<PROJECT_ROOT>/node_modules
```

## TypeScript

Generating TypeScript type definitions from Flow makes it possible to type check
the project with stricter rules, providing at the same time type definitions for
users of other type system.

Type definition interfaces for the two type systems are inherently identical,
but we can't guarantee the same level of type coverage for TypeScript
definitions, due to the intrinsic differences between Flow and TypeScript.

TypeScript `.d.ts` files are located in the `dist/typescript` folder, an
`index.d.ts` file located on the root of the repository allows the TypeScript
compiler to locate them, no additional configuration is needed to consume the
typings.
