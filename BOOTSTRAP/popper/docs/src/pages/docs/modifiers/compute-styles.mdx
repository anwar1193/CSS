# Compute Styles

The `computeStyles` modifier prepares the styles that will get written to the
DOM in the next phase, `write`. This includes rounding the offsets and deciding
what properties to use (e.g. `gpuAcceleration`).

<x-ad />

## Phase

`beforeWrite`

## Options

```flow
type Options = {
  gpuAcceleration: boolean,
};
```

### `gpuAcceleration`

This determines whether GPU-accelerated styles are used to position the popper.

- `true`: Popper will use the 3D transforms on high PPI displays and 2D
  transforms on low PPI displays.
- `false`: Popper will use `top/left` properties.

```js
createPopper(reference, popper, {
  modifiers: [
    {
      name: 'computeStyles',
      options: {
        gpuAcceleration: false, // true by default
      },
    },
  ],
});
```
